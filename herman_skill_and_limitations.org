#+title: my skills and limitations
#+filetags: :me:
* skills
+ programming :: gennerally, I can craft a working system.
+ learning :: I adapt to a new concept/tool/routine really quickly
+ focused :: I'm easily getting in a state of high focus.
+ tool familiarness ::
  + clojure, emacs-lisp :: faimiliar. I could get to most LISPs really quickly.
  + c(++), java, python, ECMAScript :: I could read, write and debug.
  + git :: basic usage
  + remote server commands :: basic usage (need references).
  + emacs :: very much (still use references a lot)
  + vim :: basic usage, evil-compatiable ones.
  + emacs-based source code editing and debugging :: very much
  + terminal working environment :: basic usage
* interest
+ information collection with automation :: I already have some ideas
+ LISP :: I want to use LISP where possible
+ language :: I'm interested in making a new domain-specific programming language(like as an extension language)
+ extensible and specific :: I generally want to write software that is designed to be extensible so that user could modify flexibly to their needs, yet specific enough(with functions) to be powerful.
+ try devop ideas in the group project
+ command-line tool interface :: I'm interested to develop software with a command-line tool interface.



+ productivity :: like scheduling, information gathering
+ note-taking
+ music :: something to do with music, like generation or visualization.
+ game

* limitations
+ estimating :: I don't estimate the scale well, so I might end up developing a prototype with too much work to be done by DDL
  I fix this by using some heuristic estimation algorithms(like break things down to roughly 30m works.).
+ distraction :: I'm easy to got distract, so there's chance I end up building a subsystem that we don't really need/use, and too exausted to have any valid idea.
  I fix this by make plan and stick to them.
  A (peer-)supervisor who challenge me would be another good fix.
+ social :: I don't really have good social instincts, nor willing to invest very much time in that, so I treat people with equal respect and my own way(which could be described as kind of indifferent), which may be counter-intuitive to certain social culture.
+ experience :: I'm not experienced to large project. my largest project is a single-file emacs-lisp extension with 648 lines
